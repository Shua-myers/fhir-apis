# fhir-apis
- Sample FHIR APIs built in different langauges
- MVP:
  - CRUDS for at least 1 resource
  - Tests for each endpoint
    - pytest
    - doctest where it makes sense
  - Needs to read/write somewhere
    - local db
    - public test servers
  - documentation
    - install, run, and test api's and related resources
    - extra comments in code, assuming users new to the language/framework


## FHIR API Starters:
- Python
  - Here:
    - FastAPI (in progress)
  - Other projects:
    - [fhirstarter](https://pypi.org/project/fhirstarter/)
      - made some minor contributions, mostly a user
      - inspiration for this project
      - FastAPI example is a cruder, simpler implementation
      - would consider using in a Python dev environment
